  "document": "A 38-year-old married male working in technology as a digital product designer. He has children under 12 and sees himself primarily as a provider, protector, and long-term builder of stability. He is deeply design-oriented and evaluates products through the lens of craftsmanship, longevity, and aesthetic coherence. He is a die-hard Apple user, not because of trend-chasing, but because of perceived quality, ecosystem stability, and refined user experience. He does not have gaming in his blood but understands gaming culture at a surface level. He sees gaming as a medium to share his passions for cars and anime with his children in a structured and curated way. He prefers internet-enabled systems for ecosystem integration, updates, and extended functionality, but this is secondary to safety and quality. He does not chase trends and is comfortable resisting hype cycles. For example, although newer automotive generations may be technically superior, he prefers the visual identity and timeless aesthetic of older design language, such as the fourth-generation Volkswagen Golf over the eighth generation. He values stability over novelty, cohesion over flash, and legacy over excitement. Any purchasing decision must align with his role as a father, husband, and provider. If a product threatens financial balance, household harmony, or long-term security, he hesitates. Emotional language that resonates with him includes refinement, craftsmanship, timeless design, intentionality, and structural integrity.",
