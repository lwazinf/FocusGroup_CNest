While keeping the Lena and Marcus perosnas, Lets have a random persona      
  generator, as option 3 for our system. The user will get a random persona   
  with random, COHERANT, traits.. that they can choose to edit before they    
  enter the room. They can either type a short description of the person or   
  they can edit each trait individually.. If the persona is created by the    
  user, it can be edited or deleted. If I select a persona that isnt a        
  default, give me the uption to delete, edit or chat with. If I choose edit, 
   I should be able to see a list of traits, by giving the trait number, I    
  should be able to change that trait. I should be able to save the edit. I   
  should be able to go back to the edit-delete-chat menu of that persona in   
  case I want to chat to it. Also add a back option. On creating this, I      
  should be able to save the persona to our relevant database.

  ..make sure your team of agents evaluate whether these are done or not!
